    <h2>Status</h2>
    <p>This is a draft, work-in-progress analysis derived from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/Closing_the_gap_with_native">“Closing
        the Gap with Native” Headlight task force</a>.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>To compare the various existing mobile apps development approaches, two
      main perspectives can be taken:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>from the end-user perspective: how well the said development approach
        will make it possible to provide the best possible user experience;</li>
      <li>from the content and service provider perspective: how well the said
        development approach will optimize their costs and benefits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This document applies the <a href="http://w3c-webmob.github.io/gap-analysis/ux-comparison-framework.html">model developed separately to
        analyze a give mobile app development approach from the end-user
        experience perspective</a> to the kind of user experience Web apps allow
      currently.</p>
